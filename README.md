### App Idea
**App Name:** "WhatsApp Version 2"

This is like WhatsApp but smarter. When you send a message in English, your friend can see it in their own language, like Spanish or French. The app will translate messages for both of you automatically. Itâ€™s useful for talking to people who speak other languages. 

**Key Features:**
- Messages translate in real-time.
- Each user picks their language.
- Group chats work with different languages.
- Voice messages also translate.
- You can switch between the original and translated text.
